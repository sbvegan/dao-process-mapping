It includes any activity around the [OPerating Manual](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/OPerating-manual) that defines what the collective does, who is responsible for what, how standard processes are completed, and how success is measured.

This supports Governance Accessibility by helping the collective look at existing workflows in a new way and help keep focus on strategic planning. It does this by understanding and communicating the process easier and helps identify flaws in the process and where improvements can be made.
